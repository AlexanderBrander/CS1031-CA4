                            <p>I have a deep interest in music that stems from my family who taught me different instruments growing up. 
                            Some of my earliest memories in life are going to my uncle's gigs where he played in a country/rock band which left a lasting 
                            impression on me growing up and left a sense of nostalgia ingrained within me. I have a strong passion for old rock and roll music and developed 
                            an interest in playing electric guitar at a young age and, naturally, my guitaring idol is Jimi Hendrix and through my teens I became obsessed
                            with his style and playing. </p>
                            <li><h4>Playing Guitar</h4></li>
                            <p>I started playing at age 6 but developed a real hunger for playing in my early teens. I've realised from my experience in playing that
                                it takes a great deal of practice, hard work and dedication to master a skill. I would have jam sessions with my friends from school
                                and most of my friendships came from this passion as I was able to relate to people through music.
