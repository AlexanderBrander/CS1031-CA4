                        <h2>Development Summary</h2>
                        <p>I started by creating the navigation bar and the banner and styling them using css. I made the design choice of making it clean but eyecatching.
                            I then created the page contents and it was challenging to get each element to be where I wanted them. Next I added the navigation and buttons
                            to get from page to page.
                            Finally I worked on researching the chat app given the sample code and implementing some features.

                        <h2>Main Hobby</h2>
                        <h4>Music</h4>
                            <p>I have a deep interest in music that stems from my family who taught me different instruments growing up. 
                            Some of my earliest memories in life are going to my uncle's gigs where he played in a country/rock band which left a lasting 
                            impression on me growing up and left a sense of nostalgia ingrained within me. I have a strong passion for old rock and roll music and developed 
                            an interest in playing electric guitar at a young age and, naturally, my guitaring idol is Jimi Hendrix and through my teens I became obsessed
                            with his style and playing. </p> <br><br>
                        <h4>Playing Guitar</h4>
                            <p>I started playing at age 6 but developed a real hunger for playing in my early teens. I've realised from my experience in playing that
                                it takes a great deal of practice, hard work and dedication to master a skill. I would have jam sessions with my friends from school
                                and most of my friendships came from this passion as I was able to relate to people through music.
